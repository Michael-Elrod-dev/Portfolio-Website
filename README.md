## Motivation
The creation of this portfolio website serves as an online showcase of the technical and creative skills I've used to create many different projects throughout both my academic journey and my free time. It contains detailed information about my academic achievements, work experience, skills, projects, as well as a more generalized version of my resume.

## Design Reasoning
The website structure is designed with simplicity and user friendliness in mind. It is divided into various sections to provide a clear and concise representation of all the information it contains. The website is also responsive to ensure a smooth user experience on various devices and screen sizes.

## Work Flow

### index.html
This file serves as the entry point and contains the HTML markup for the website.

### style.css
Located in the `/css/` directory, this file contains the CSS styles that are applied throughout the website.

### index.js
This file contains the JavaScript code that adds interactivity to the website. It includes scripts for handling form submissions, navigation bar functionality, animations, and other interactive elements of the website.

### Fonts
The `/webfonts/` directory contains all the font files used in the website such along with some extras.

## Future Work
In the future, more features can be added to the website such as a blog section, and more interactive UI elements. It would also be beneficial to incorporate analytics to gather visitor data and gain insights about user behavior on the website.
